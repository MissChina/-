        "questionNameText": "<p>Passage Two</p><p>        This is one of two schools in Richmond where the city has installed new enforcement cameras to catch speeders. Fitz Patrick has two children at the school. She is also a traffic safety advocate for the nonprofit Greater Richmond Fit4Kids, which is why she owns a radar gun (雷达测速器).</p><p>        Still, Fitz Patrick has mixed feelings about the speed cameras. She would rather see the whole street redesigned to discourage speeding and protect walkers and bicyclists. But she also knows that will not happen anytime soon.</p><p>        The number of traffic deaths has risen sharply over the past decade, and safety advocates around the country are desperately searching for anything that will get drivers to slow down. But critics say speed cameras can be a financial burden on those who are least able to pay. Still, they have earned the support of important safety advocates, including Jonathan Adkins, the chief executive officer of the Governors Highway Safety Association.</p><p>        Police departments in many places have scaled down their traffic enforcement, Adkins says, and speeding and careless driving seem to be getting worse. He says automated cameras can help fill that blank. “The question is, how do we arrange them in a fair way with the public support?” Adkins said.</p><p>        No one likes getting a speeding ticket. But the objections to automated traffic enforcement go deeper than that. “It is doubtful that safety is the real goal,” said Jay Beeber, with the National Motorists Association, a driver advocacy group.</p><p>        “We need to make sure that our cities have all the tools that are effective to reduce traffic deaths,” said Laura Friedman, a state lawmaker in California who sponsored the state law authorizing automated cameras. “We make sure it can’t be a money grab, because the money can only be used for physical speed-lowering improvements on the same streets where you’re using the cameras,” she said. “So it’s really about changing the culture and slowing traffic down.”</p>",

        "questionNameText": "<p>Passage Three</p><p>        Experts suggest that Americans stop worrying about getting a perfect eight hours of sleep, and warn that stressing about the magic number may actually result in a drop in sleep quality and duration.</p><p>        Dr. Reena Mehra, a director of sleep research at the Cleveland Clinic, held that focusing too much on falling asleep may interrupt the process. “It works against the individual,” she said.</p><p>        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than a third of Americans do not achieve the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep per night. The agency also found that quality sleep is determined by major sleep episodes that do not have frequent awakenings.</p><p>        One paper looking into the ideal amount of sleep found that “Sleep duration recommendations issued by public health authorities help to inform the population of interventions, policies, and healthy sleep behaviors. However, the ideal amount of sleep required each night can vary between different individuals due to gene-related factors and other reasons, and it is important to adapt our recommendations on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p>        In the past, a lack of sleep was a sign to bosses that a person was productive and successful. But today, people try to create strategies to make the best use of their rest.</p><p>        Researchers, scientists, psychologists and individuals in the sleep business said that the best course of action when it comes to sleep is to relax.</p><p>        Albert Einstein College of Medicine clinical associate professor of psychology Dr. Shelby Harris said patterns and routines are more important than the magic eight-hour number. However, she stressed that people do not need to be so rigid that they can no longer sleep at all if they have to break from their routine to work late or deal with a restless child. Harris also noted that it is essential to remember that humans were able to sleep peacefully well before the invention of drugs and technology. “The pressure we put on ourselves is making sleep worse,” she said.</p>",

It blends the essence of traditional Chinese culture with modern aesthetics. I decorated it with Chinese knots which symbolize fortune and wealth in our culture. On one side of the bag, I also embroidered a charming scenery of Mount Tai, the most sacred mountain in China.</p><p>        There are two reasons for me to make the gift. Firstly, the gift with Chinese elements will help more people know about Chinese culture. Secondly, the bag with herbs and spices will be good for our health because it not only smells fragrant but keeps some harmful insects away.</p><p>        I am looking forward to seeing you.</p><p>                                                                                                                                                 Yours,</p><p>                                                                                                                                                 Li Hua</p>",
