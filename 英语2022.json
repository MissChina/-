They were loving, playful animals like all puppies. Now, however,these puppies are on the road to becoming useful members of society. If they prove themselves able, they could become guide dogs. They will help to improve the lives of people with vision loss and vision impairment. These faithful-friends-to-be are part of a training program of an organization called the Guiding Eyes for the Blind. Born in New York, these puppies spent the first two months of their lives with their mothers. They were bred (饲养）for health and the way they respond to their environment.</p><p>\tHowever,breeding alone will not be enough to turn these puppies into guide dogs. The puppies flew from the organization's head office in New York to Maryland. They will need training from dog training experts. They will also need to be looked after by volunteers（志愿者）called the Puppy Raisers.The goal of this caring by the Puppy Raisers and their families is to turn the dynamic, playful puppies into well-behaved dogs. These are the qualities needed for a successful guide dog: well-bred, well-trained, and well-behaved.</p><p>\tThe process will take about 14 to 16 months of weekly classes and testing.

        "questionNameText": "<p>Passage Three </p><p>\tFood delivery services are a major contributor to single-use plastic waste. Plastic containers, drinking cups, and straws make up about 269,000 tons of plastic found in the oceans. </p><p>\tRestrictions on in-person dining during the COVID-19 pandemic lead many consumers to shift from in-person dining to takeout orders,increasing plastic waste. For something that is used very briefly for convenience,single-use plastics have long-term environmental consequences.Luckily, there are several ways for consumers to reduce their plastic use to the lowest level. The first thing that anyone can do is simply not to use single-use plastics when it is not necessary. Consumers can refuse the use of unnecessary single-use items when they order takeout.</p><p>\t“If you'd like to see plastic waste reduced, write in the notes when you order that you don't want the extra packaging that might typically come with your order,” says John Mann, executive director of a nonprofit organization. “Call and politely tell them you support reducing plastic waste and see if they've considered moving to reusable packaging or other things that aren't plastic.\" “While individuals play a large part in demanding companies and manufacturers to act and commit to sustainability,a top-down approach from policymakers may immediately and significantly reduce waste,” says Moore,a Californian environmentalist. “Single-use plastic bans(禁令）have shown to be effective in reducing waste.” </p><p>\tAccording to a 2019 study,California's ban on single-use plastic carryout bags can reduce 40 million pounds of plastic per year. Banning or imposing a tax on all single-use items, not just plastics,can be a much more effective strategy for reducing consumption and global sea pollution. “If manufacturers were made responsible for disposing of or taking back the products and packaging they create,we would see a large-scale shift toward more circular models of consumption,” says Moore. On the policy side,there is some movement toward holding manufacturers responsible for the life cycle of the products they produce,given that consumers and governments have been stuck with the disposal of large amounts of packaging and waste for decades,Moore adds. This kind of policy approach is called Extended Producer Responsibility. It is up to each of us to encourage our policymakers to continue promoting environmentally friendly behavior. </p><p><br></p><p>Restrictions on in-person dining during the COVID-19 pandemic result in _____.</p>",

        "questionNameText": "<p>Passage Three </p><p>\tFood delivery services are a major contributor to single-use plastic waste. Plastic containers, drinking cups, and straws make up about 269,000 tons of plastic found in the oceans. </p><p>\tRestrictions on in-person dining during the COVID-19 pandemic lead many consumers to shift from in-person dining to takeout orders,increasing plastic waste. For something that is used very briefly for convenience,single-use plastics have long-term environmental consequences.Luckily, there are several ways for consumers to reduce their plastic use to the lowest level. The first thing that anyone can do is simply not to use single-use plastics when it is not necessary. Consumers can refuse the use of unnecessary single-use items when they order takeout.</p><p>\t“If you'd like to see plastic waste reduced, write in the notes when you order that you don't want the extra packaging that might typically come with your order,” says John Mann, executive director of a nonprofit organization. “Call and politely tell them you support reducing plastic waste and see if they've considered moving to reusable packaging or other things that aren't plastic.\" “While individuals play a large part in demanding companies and manufacturers to act and commit to sustainability,a top-down approach from policymakers may immediately and significantly reduce waste,” says Moore,a Californian environmentalist. “Single-use plastic bans(禁令）have shown to be effective in reducing waste.” </p><p>\tAccording to a 2019 study,California's ban on single-use plastic carryout bags can reduce 40 million pounds of plastic per year. Banning or imposing a tax on all single-use items, not just plastics,can be a much more effective strategy for reducing consumption and global sea pollution. “If manufacturers were made responsible for disposing of or taking back the products and packaging they create,we would see a large-scale shift toward more circular models of consumption,” says Moore. On the policy side,there is some movement toward holding manufacturers responsible for the life cycle of the products they produce,given that consumers and governments have been stuck with the disposal of large amounts of packaging and waste for decades,Moore adds. This kind of policy approach is called Extended Producer Responsibility. It is up to each of us to encourage our policymakers to continue promoting environmentally friendly behavior. </p><p><br></p><p>What is the author's attitude toward reducing plastic waste?</p>",
