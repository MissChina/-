        "questionNameText": "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Passage Two</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">      The man who made the first call from a wireless phone is now 94 years old. The year was 1973.&nbsp;Martin Cooper operated a large, heavy new communication device on a street in New York. The&nbsp;device was not physically connected to phone lines. But, Cooper was able to make use of it--he&nbsp;called a technology business competitor.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Fifty years later, the inventor says he hopes wireless phones can make life better but he also&nbsp;expresses some worries.&nbsp;“My most negative opinion is that&nbsp;we don't have any privacy anymore&nbsp;because everything about us is now recorded someplace,” Cooper said. And, he says he is concerned&nbsp;about how easily young people can link to harmful online materials on their mobile phones. Cooper spoke with the Associated Press from Barcelona, where he attended the Mobile World Congress&nbsp;(MWC), the biggest telecom industry trade show. Cooper received an award there for his lifetime of&nbsp;work.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  He believes the technology's best days may still be ahead in areas such as education and health&nbsp;care. “Between the cellphone and medical technology and the internet, we are going to cure disease,”&nbsp;he said at the MWC.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Cooper was working for Motorola when he used the Dyna-Tac phone to make a call in April 1973. Things have changed greatly since then. But,&nbsp;he said, “We had no way of&nbsp;knowing&nbsp;<u>this</u>&nbsp;was&nbsp;the&nbsp;historic moment.”Cooper says there are still ways for mobile phones to change. The first one he&nbsp;used weighed over 1 kilogram. Today, they are small. But he thinks one day they will be more like&nbsp;a part of our body than something we hold.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  He says perhaps the human body can even power the phones.&nbsp;“The human body is the charging&nbsp;station, right,” he asked. The body makes energy from food, he argues, so it could possibly also power a phone. Instead of&nbsp;holding the phone in the hand, for example, the device could be placed under the skin.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Cooper says he also hopes there can be more protection for internet users concerned about privacy and for children. Speaking about privacy concerns, he said,&nbsp;“It's going to get resolved, but&nbsp;not easily.” He also says there should be a special internet for children so they do not run into&nbsp;materials made for adults.</p>",

The year was 1973.&nbsp;Martin Cooper operated a large, heavy new communication device on a street in New York. The&nbsp;device was not physically connected to phone lines. But, Cooper was able to make use of it--he&nbsp;called a technology business competitor.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Fifty years later, the inventor says he hopes wireless phones can make life better but he also&nbsp;expresses some worries.&nbsp;“My most negative opinion is that&nbsp;we don't have any privacy anymore&nbsp;because everything about us is now recorded someplace,” Cooper said. And, he says he is concerned&nbsp;about how easily young people can link to harmful online materials on their mobile phones. Cooper spoke with the Associated Press from Barcelona, where he attended the Mobile World Congress&nbsp;(MWC), the biggest telecom industry trade show. Cooper received an award there for his lifetime of&nbsp;work.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  He believes the technology's best days may still be ahead in areas such as education and health&nbsp;care. “Between the cellphone and medical technology and the internet, we are going to cure disease,”&nbsp;he said at the MWC.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Cooper was working for Motorola when he used the Dyna-Tac phone to make a call in April 1973. Things have changed greatly since then. But,&nbsp;he said, “We had no way of&nbsp;knowing&nbsp;<u>this</u>&nbsp;was&nbsp;the&nbsp;historic moment.”Cooper says there are still ways for mobile phones to change.

But he thinks one day they will be more like&nbsp;a part of our body than something we hold.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  He says perhaps the human body can even power the phones.&nbsp;“The human body is the charging&nbsp;station, right,” he asked. The body makes energy from food, he argues, so it could possibly also power a phone. Instead of&nbsp;holding the phone in the hand, for example, the device could be placed under the skin.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Cooper says he also hopes there can be more protection for internet users concerned about privacy and for children. Speaking about privacy concerns, he said,&nbsp;“It's going to get resolved, but&nbsp;not easily.” He also says there should be a special internet for children so they do not run into&nbsp;materials made for adults.</p>",

        "questionNameText": "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Passage Two</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">      The man who made the first call from a wireless phone is now 94 years old. The year was 1973.&nbsp;Martin Cooper operated a large, heavy new communication device on a street in New York. The&nbsp;device was not physically connected to phone lines. But, Cooper was able to make use of it--he&nbsp;called a technology business competitor.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Fifty years later, the inventor says he hopes wireless phones can make life better but he also&nbsp;expresses some worries.&nbsp;“My most negative opinion is that&nbsp;we don't have any privacy anymore&nbsp;because everything about us is now recorded someplace,” Cooper said. And, he says he is concerned&nbsp;about how easily young people can link to harmful online materials on their mobile phones. Cooper spoke with the Associated Press from Barcelona, where he attended the Mobile World Congress&nbsp;(MWC), the biggest telecom industry trade show. Cooper received an award there for his lifetime of&nbsp;work.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  He believes the technology's best days may still be ahead in areas such as education and health&nbsp;care. “Between the cellphone and medical technology and the internet, we are going to cure disease,”&nbsp;he said at the MWC.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Cooper was working for Motorola when he used the Dyna-Tac phone to make a call in April 1973. Things have changed greatly since then. But,&nbsp;he said, “We had no way of&nbsp;knowing&nbsp;<u>this</u>&nbsp;was&nbsp;the&nbsp;historic moment.”Cooper says there are still ways for mobile phones to change. The first one he&nbsp;used weighed over 1 kilogram. Today, they are small. But he thinks one day they will be more like&nbsp;a part of our body than something we hold.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  He says perhaps the human body can even power the phones.&nbsp;“The human body is the charging&nbsp;station, right,” he asked. The body makes energy from food, he argues, so it could possibly also power a phone. Instead of&nbsp;holding the phone in the hand, for example, the device could be placed under the skin.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Cooper says he also hopes there can be more protection for internet users concerned about privacy and for children. Speaking about privacy concerns, he said,&nbsp;“It's going to get resolved, but&nbsp;not easily.” He also says there should be a special internet for children so they do not run into&nbsp;materials made for adults.</p>",

Dunlop added, “When there were fewer of them, there was a lot of singing--now that there are lots of them, no need to be singing so much.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Scientists first began to hear and study the complex songs of the humpback whales in the 1970s.&nbsp;They used underwater microphones to&nbsp;do so.&nbsp;Only male whales sing. Eastern Australia's humpback whales came close to disappearing in the 1960s, when their number dropped to around 200.

While 2 in 10 males made singing noises in 2004, 10 years later the number had dropped to 1 in 10, Dunlop said. Dunlop thought singing played a big part in bringing in mates when populations were severely reduced. “It was hard just to find other whales in the area, because there weren't many.”&nbsp;she added. When humpbacks live in denser populations, males looking for mates also have to deal with competing whales. Dunlop explained the singing noises might bring in other possible mates.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  The research suggests the seas are still noisy with humpback whale sounds. Many humpbacks seek to bring in mates with a combination of singing and physical movements, the study notes.</p><p>\t  The large increase in the humpback population during the study period provided valuable data about changes in the animals’&nbsp;behavior, said Simon Ingram. He studies humpback whales at the University of Plymouth in Britain. Ingram said humpback whales must have been singers long before whaling reduced their numbers. He added that the new study demonstrated how necessary their complex and beautiful songs were to their survival and recovery.</p>",

Scientists who recorded humpback whale behavior in Australia discovered that fewer whales made the singing noises as their population grew.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  “Humpback whale song is loud and travels far in the ocean.”&nbsp;said Rebecca Dunlop of the&nbsp;University of Queensland. She has long studied humpback whales and helped lead the new study. Her work has centered on humpbacks that reproduce near Australia's Great Barrier Reef.&nbsp;Dunlop made an unexpected finding as whale numbers sharply rose following the end of commercial whaling（捕鲸）.&nbsp;“It was getting more difficult to actually find singers,”she said. Dunlop added, “When there were fewer of them, there was a lot of singing--now that there are lots of them, no need to be singing so much.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  Scientists first began to hear and study the complex songs of the humpback whales in the 1970s.&nbsp;They used underwater microphones to&nbsp;do so.&nbsp;Only male whales sing. Eastern Australia's humpback whales came close to disappearing in the 1960s, when their number dropped to around 200. But over time the population began to regrow, climbing to about 27,000 whales by 2015. That number is near estimated pre-whaling levels.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  As the density of whales increased, their singing behaviors changed. While 2 in 10 males made singing noises in 2004, 10 years later the number had dropped to 1 in 10, Dunlop said. Dunlop thought singing played a big part in bringing in mates when populations were severely reduced. “It was hard just to find other whales in the area, because there weren't many.”&nbsp;she added. When humpbacks live in denser populations, males looking for mates also have to deal with competing whales. Dunlop explained the singing noises might bring in other possible mates.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  The research suggests the seas are still noisy with humpback whale sounds. Many humpbacks seek to bring in mates with a combination of singing and physical movements, the study notes.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t  The large increase in the humpback population during the study period provided valuable data about changes in the animals’&nbsp;behavior, said Simon Ingram. He studies humpback whales at the University of Plymouth in Britain. Ingram said humpback whales must have been singers long before whaling reduced their numbers. He added that the new study demonstrated how necessary their complex and beautiful songs were to their survival and recovery.</p>",
