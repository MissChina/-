There are no decorative objects lying around—just the essentials. You open the closet to find you can count the number of clothing items inside on one hand. The space seems more like a prison cell than a home, and you may think the resident cannot afford to buy more things to fill the apartment with.</p><p>\tIt turns out that the apartment's owner is minimalist(简约主义者) who chooses to limit his number of belongings. Minimalism goes against consumer society by dramatically reducing possessions.

        "questionNameText": "<p>Passage Two</p><p>\tImagine walking through someone's apartment. The rooms are almost empty, and the only pieces of furniture are a simple table and folded sofa. There are no decorative objects lying around—just the essentials. You open the closet to find you can count the number of clothing items inside on one hand. The space seems more like a prison cell than a home, and you may think the resident cannot afford to buy more things to fill the apartment with.</p><p>\tIt turns out that the apartment's owner is minimalist(简约主义者) who chooses to limit his number of belongings. Minimalism goes against consumer society by dramatically reducing possessions. Minimalists follow this philosophy to varying degrees, but they generally claim that cutting back on excess stuff leads to a more fulfilling life.</p><p>\tWith fewer possessions, they do not have to spend as much time cleaning, thinking about what they are missing, or trying to keep up with the latest trends! Minimalists say this frees up their time for things that they find meaningful, such as exercising, traveling, and being with loved ones.</p><p>\tExtreme minimalism is not for everyone, but a mild form of it has grown in popularity recently, thanks to Marie Kondo's best-selling book. <em>The Life-Changing magic of Tidying Up</em>. Kondo has become distinguished for her tiding skills, which she developed naturally one of her main belongings is that one should only own things that one truly loves.</p><p>\tIt can be unpleasant to part with belongings, but Kondo's methods have helped millions to remove useless things. Her technique for making space is to go through things by category, starting with clothing, then books, papers, tiny objects, and finally, memorable items. She instructs her followers to touch each object they own and keep only those that spark joy, promising that this will lead to domestic happiness.</p><p>\tKondo stresses that it is not about throwing things away, but about \"finding the things you want to remain with you\" and striking a balance between personal joy and possessions. Even if you are not ready to become a minimalist, you may want to consider reducing the number of things you own for it seems that letting go of things can truly make room for happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the last paragraph, what is the real meaning of minimalism?</p>",
